# A Mira Assessment Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task One

Build a CRUD application using the free fake API at jsonplaceholder [JsonPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/).
Your API should have basic form validations.

## Task Two

Build a Chart using the IMDB API from RapidAPI at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/).
Mapped the awards array, adding a count property for the year occurrences.

## Motivation

> **Note:** I certainly would've like to do more but this is what i could come up with base on my understanding of the given tasks.
